# Mohini0104-CSS-Task-4-Making-Of-Navigation-Bar-with-Double-DropDown
Hi, there This is my CSS task#4 for the CSS assignment series in this I'm making an navbar with double dropdowns.
DropDown1: In this DropDown you will see vertical menu which we will get by hovering the parent navbar.
DropDown2:The only difference in this dropdown is that its vertical in alignment which we will get by hovering around the courses .

I hope you will like it. ThankYou.
